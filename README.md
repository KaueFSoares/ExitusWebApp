# Exitus - Admin Application - *on development*

**Project current version deployed at:** [admin.exitus.website](https://admin.exitus.website)

Welcome to the web application designed for administrators of the Exitus platform!

## Introduction

The Exitus platform is a solution developed to simplify and enhance access control for students and employees at IFSUL Campus Sapiranga. With a variety of features including student and responsible management, detailed entry and exit records, administrator authentication, and early exit scheduling, this platform is designed to ensure security, agility and convenience.

## Key Features

### 1. Administrator Authentication (Login) - Pending

The system features a secure authentication mechanism for administrators. Log in using your provided credentials to access the complete control panel.

### 2. Student Management - Pending

The system enables organized registration and administration of students. You can add new students, update information, and check individual details when needed.

### 3. Guardian Management - Pending

Streamline control by maintaining records of student guardians. Add, update, or remove contact information to ensure effective communication.

### 4. Entry and Exit Logging - Pending

Every student movement is recorded by the system. Through the administrator panel, it's possible to modify and include records.

### 5. Early Exit Scheduling - Pending

A critical feature is the scheduling of early exits for underage students. This ensures students can only leave the school premises with authorization, providing additional security.
